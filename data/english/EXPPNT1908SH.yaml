intro_experience: "You will experience one of the most interesting SHARED Experiences of the Argentine Patagonia. We will cross Chile´s border to get to know the Perito Moreno Glacier, one of the largest and still advancing glaciers in the world. Every so often, the growth of this glacier is such that it generates an event called Breaking, creating one of the most amazing & unique events in the world."
description: "<p>We will depart from our Hotel in Puerto Natales or BMT Meeting point around 06:30 hrs to start a 5 and a half hour trip, which will take us from Puerto Natales to <strong>Perito Moreno glacier</strong>, in Argentina. On the way we will make several detentions. The first, at the border crossing Cerro Castillo (Chilean side) &amp; Cancha Carrera (Argentine side), where we will perform the customs and migration procedures.</p>
<p>Our second stop will be at the bus terminal in <strong>El Calafate</strong>, where we will have time to have a coffee and use the toilets. In this place, a guide will join the group, who will accompany us to our visit to <strong>Los Glaciares National Park</strong>, protected wild area where the glacier is located.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once in the National Park, we will travel for 2 hours over 3 km of walkways in front of the Perito Moreno glacier. In the route we will find several viewpoints, from where we can have views from different angles of the ice mass, being able to appreciate ice landslides of more than 70 m. We will also have the opportunity to sail in front of the glacier for 1 hour (Navigation upon request when visiting Glacier.) You will spend the day watching the glacier slowly move, but the event that will make your day complete is when sections of the ice suddenly calve into the chilly waters below. Even small calvings can send a roar into the sky, but occasionally sections the size of buses tumble into the lake, where they start their journey bobbing about as icebergs.</p>
<p>As the glacier stretches across the lake it forms a natural dam. The pressure of the water forms a tube of ice that, every few years, collapses in a terrific explosion. This event can last 1 or 2 days, offering a spectacular show of singular beauty. // Time to enjoy Boxlunch. In the afternoon, our driver will be waiting to start our return to <strong>Puerto Natales</strong> or meeting point BMYTRIP.</p>"
