description: "<p>We will depart from our Hotel in <strong>Puerto Natales</strong> or BMT Meeting Point at 07:30 in the morning. We start the navigation around 08:00 hrs. from Puerto Bories pier towards <strong>Bernardo O'Higgins National Park</strong> through the Señoret Channel, while enjoying a delicious coffee accompanied by a sweet snack. During the trip we can see <strong>Mount Balmaceda</strong>, place where the glaciers that we will visit are located.</p>
<p>Our first point of interest during this Experience is observe from the boat will be the Puerto Bories National Historical Monument, founded in 1913 by the Tierra del Fuego Exploitation Society, which for more than 60 years was the most important slaughter center in South Patagonia, nowdays it has become a luxury Hotel-Museum. Its masonry constructions stand out, industrial architecture style post Victorian English. On our way, while we are sailing towards our destination, we will visit the <strong>Condors waterfall & Cliffs</strong>. The trip continues towards <strong>Mount Balmaceda</strong>, 2,035 meters high, where we can appreciate the glacier with the same name. Then we will disembark in <strong>Puerto Toro</strong> to start a guided walk along the shore of the Laguna Témpanos (Icebergs Lagoon), through a native forest of coigües, ñirres and ciruelillos, towards the mouth of <strong>Serrano Glacier</strong>. Here we will enjoy the vegetation and the contrast between the sky and the sea ice, accompanied by the imposing glacier. Upon returning from the hike we will return to embark and enjoy a deserved aperitif with ice from the glacier (thrusts of the glacier). </p>
<p>After having witnessed a unique, wild and virgin landscape, we returned to the course to enjoy a patagonian barbeque (tasty lamb barbeque at the Magellan style stick) at <strong>Estancia Perales</strong>, Puerto Consuelo.</p>
<p> In the afternoon, our driver will be waiting to begin our return to Puerto Natales hotels or BMYTRIP meeting point.</p>"
