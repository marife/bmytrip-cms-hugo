description: '<p>We will depart from Hotel in Puerto Natales or Bmytrip Meeting point at 07:00 am heading to  <strong>Torres del Paine National Park</strong>, direct transfer through the mythical Route 9 to Estancia Cerro Paine, starting point of our Experience. We will start our trekking around 09:00 hrs, after a crompehensive lecture by our guide. Afterwards we will take the trail towards <strong>Ascencio Valley</strong> and after 10 minutes walking, we will cross an old suspension bridge that crosses the <strong>Ascencio River</strong>, about 150 meters ahead, a bifurcation appears: our destiny ... Base Torres.</p>
<p>Then follows a zigzag of marked slope and scarce vegetation, we will see the windy and spectacular <strong>Ascencio Valley</strong>. After almost an hour of walking; We will arrive at the <strong>El Chileno Camping</strong> on the opposite bank of the Ascencio River. Then begins our second chapter of the trekking, with a complete change of vegetation. Up to this point it corresponds to the <strong>Pre-Andean bushes ""Matorral""</strong> and that from then on it will completely change, since it will go into an old Lenga forest where we will ascend gently until we reach the moraine of the <strong>Torres Glacier</strong> (at 600 meters above sea level).</p>
<p>When leaving the forest we will have one last climb, walking for 45 minutes uphill. The trail will take us to the base Torres (at 870 masl), <strong>the 3 granite giants (Central, Monzino, Dagostini)</strong> and <strong>Peineta and Nido de Cóndores hills</strong>. After resting a while, we will have lunch in this extraordinary and unique scenic context, unique on the planet.</p>
<p>We begin our return along the same path until we reach the starting point, where our driver will be waiting to begin our return to <strong>Puerto Natales</strong> or BMYTRIP meeting point.</p>'
