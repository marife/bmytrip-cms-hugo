description: "<p>We will depart from Hotel in Puerto Natales or Bmytrip Meeting point, leading the New Route of access to the <strong>Torres del Paine National Park</strong> located 129 kilometers from Puerto Natales. We will enter the park through <strong>Serrano porter</strong>, here we will cancel our entrance ticket to later go to the In this place we will prepare our equipment and we will begin our ascent to the <strong>Ferrier Viewpoint</strong>, located in the mountain of the same name. This Experience is an excellent opportunity to begin to familiarize ourselves with the more than 242,000 hectares of National Park.</p>
<p>Our experience makes us ascend slowly. Once at the top, we will have free time to recharge our batteries, get pictures of this incredible panoramic view of the park, which includes the view of the <strong>Grey Glacier </strong>that gives life to <strong>Grey Lake</strong> with its ice floes floating in the water, the turquoise waters of <strong>Lake Pehoe</strong>, the immensity of the <strong>Toro Lake </strong>and if the weather conditions allow it, the <strong>Cuernos del Paine, Sierra Baguales</strong> and other surrounding hills.</p>
<p>We will begin our descent and return to the starting point in the Lake Grey area. Later, we will enjoy a Patagonian lunch, where we will get to know <strong>Calafate Sour</strong>, Patagonian cocktail that worth to try. After this lunch, we will continue to the beach and Grey island to reach the viewpoint of the Grey Glacier and observe the icebergs that we saw from the top, but this time, in front of us. We believe that as an experience it is the perfect way to familiarize ourselves with the landscapes of Torres del Paine National Park. Finally our driver is waiting for us to take us to the hotel or Bmytrip meeting point in Puerto Natales</p>"
