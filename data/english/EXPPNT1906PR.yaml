description: '<p>We will depart from our Hotel in Puerto Natales or BMT Meeting Point around 8:00 with destination to <strong>Cueva del Milod&oacute;n</strong> located 24 kilometers (15 miles) north of Puerto Natales.This Natural Monument consists of three caverns and a rocky conglomerate called "Silla del Diablo". Before reaching the cave, the access road passes through the<strong> "Silla del Diablo"</strong>, a name that comes from the popular imagination given to a rocky structure with the appearance of an armchair which is said to be the "seat" of the Mylodon; the legend transformed into "devil".</p>
<p>After visiting this cave we will go by the new access road to the <strong>Torres del Paine National Park</strong>, being able to observe <strong>the Laguna Sof&iacute;a</strong>,<strong> the Cordillera Prat, the Porte&ntilde;o Lake, the Cerro Mesa (Mesa hill)</strong>, <strong>Toro lake</strong>, <strong>Sierra del Toro and Sierra Ballena.</strong> We will enter the <strong>Torres del Paine National Park </strong>through the <strong>Sector Serrano Porter</strong>, we will take the road over the Serrano Bridge to continue with our destination, Grey area. On this park area, we can make a pleasant walk along the shore of Grey Lake and if the conditions help us it is possible to access the viewpoint of the Grey Peninsula and appreciate the front of the glacier of the same name.</p>
<p>On the way back, in the parking lot of the Guarder&iacute;a Grey (Grey porter), we take the route back to a restaurant located in the sector, to take a moment of resting for having lunch. (Lunch included in the rate). At the end of this restful break, we began the second chapter of our visit to the Torres del Paine National Park, heading to the <strong>Salto Grande </strong>sector. We will visit the <strong>viewpoint of Nordenskj&ouml;ld Lake </strong>and continue to enjoy different views on our undulating route that brings us little by little to the sector of <strong>Laguna Amarga</strong>, without first visiting the <strong>Cascade Paine</strong>, a beautiful highlight where you can see the discharge of milky waters that come from the glaciers across the <strong>Paine River </strong>and finally drain into the Seno de Ultima Esperanza, after a prolonged way through the heart of the National Park. After admiring this pleasing spectacle, we will return to the city of Puerto Natales passing by the <strong>Mirador del Lago Sarmiento</strong> arriving at dusk and bringing an unforgettable experience.</p>'
